Hi! I’m a **Ph.D. student in Economics** at the **University of Oregon**. My research explores **cultural transmission and evolutionary game theory.**

In Korean, my name is 이재정; the closest pronunciation in English is **Jae-jeong** (rather than “Jaichung”).

Before starting my Ph.D., I received my M.A. in Economics from Seoul National University and B.A. in Economics, Philosophy, and Scranton Honors Program from Ewha Womans University.

You can reach me at [jaichung@uoregon.edu](mailto:jaichung@uoregon.edu) and view my **[CV](./cv.pdf)**.
